## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.  
- This is the first mobile app I have created with Swift, so a lot of the time was spent learning about different features and functions of Swift and Xcode.  
- Once I was more familiar with everything, completing the creation of the app did not take as much time as the initial setup, downloading, and review of all the information.  
- The colors and functionality are simple for now to ensure that all required steps were completed.
